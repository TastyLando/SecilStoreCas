This project is a .NET 8-based dynamic configuration library designed to provide seamless access to configuration keys typically stored in web.config, app.config, appsettings.json, or similar files. The library allows configurations to be stored in various storage solutions (Mongo) and accessed dynamically without requiring application restarts or deployments.

The solution is built to be robust and flexible, making it suitable for web applications, WCF services, web APIs, and more. Additionally, a web interface is provided for managing the configurations, including listing, updating, and adding new entries. Configurations can be filtered by name on the client side.
